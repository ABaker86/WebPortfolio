<p>Genfor is a skeleton character generator written in PHP. Two separate files are used to supply a list of potential first and last names. The first name list is delimited by commas whereas the last name text file is delimited by the new line character:\n.</p>

<p>The project was built with Eclips, and XAMPP (PHP &amp; Apache).</p>

<p>Eventually the PHP explode fucntion used to allocate the first and last names may be replaced with SQL database.</p>

<p>$firstName = explode(“,”, file_get_contents(‘FirstName.txt’)); $lastName = explode(“\n”, file_get_contents(‘LastName.txt’));</p>
