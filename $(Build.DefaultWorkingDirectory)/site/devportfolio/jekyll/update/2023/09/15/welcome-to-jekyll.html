<p>Over the past few years I have drifed away from spding my free time working on open-source software in an attempt to learn as much as I could about creating software with Microsoft’s .NET technology stack.</p>

<p>However, things have changed recenlty. <!--more--></p>

<p>I have taken a step back and spent some much needed time on self evalution, what I have done in my lifetine and what I still plan to do. I belive that life is a journey that involves continuous learning. Over the last 9 years, I have gone from being a business analyst, a software engineer, a team lead and solutions engineer.</p>

<p>I don’t recall every taking a position of employment with the goal of stepping into a leadership postion but it does not seem to stop it from happening. Unfortunalty, I have recently determined that I no longer enjoy the leadership postions to the level I had when I decided to persue a software engineering career path.</p>

<p>To this is end I am seeking more fulfilling employment. I belvie that people dont have a lot of time to spend on ‘busy work’. So I am seeking employment that is both enjoyable but also makes a difference in the lives of the people and community around me.</p>

<p>In the downtime between interviewing, I am burshing up on new skills and refreshing old project-this one included.</p>
