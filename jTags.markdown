# jTags

#### WEBSITE REDESIGN CONCEPT

jTags is a jQuery library used for making client-side Web development easier with ajax-calls. I came across a open Website Redesign issue on GitHub and decided to take a look. Although the functionality of the Website is adequate, the tempalte is a defalut Jekyll template for GitHub's gh-pages. Although I could have asked if the project owner needed any help with the redesign I decided to take it upon myself to redesign the home page of the website and hopefully freshen it up a little. This project is a visual design and framework exercise to challenge myself. Selecting only a few elements from the Jekyll tempate, I decided to go a completley different route. I started by selecting a light background and hilighting the header elments that I though should stand out.

As of the date of this posting, the following is the link to the jTags Website.

#### Lessons Learned: 

I did this exercise for two reasons. The first reason is that I wanted to gain additional experience in designing and developing Websites. As a developer I want to keep learning and improving on my skills. The second reason is that I thought the redesign might actually be used. Having independant project on GitHub may be great, but having contributed to an open-source proejct feels much better.

This is likely the first of several Web site redesigns that I would actually like to do more of in the future. I want to be able to go thought the entire development process of research, brainstorming, wire framing, prototyping and deployment.
