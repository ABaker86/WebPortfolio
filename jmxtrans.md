# JMXTRANS

#### WEBSITE REDESIGN CONCEPT

JMXTRANS is yet another project on GitHub that I happened to thumb across recently. It is also a project that I thought could use a little more attendtion in the project page design area. The original GitHub hosted project page used a default jekyll template that seemed very flat and did not seem to provide enough infomation to convince developers to actually contribute to the project. Under the impression that project pages are used a marketing attempt to increase project contributions, I though that it might be a good idea to spruce the JMXTRANS page up a little. 



As of the date of this posting, the following is the link to the jTags Website.

####Lessons Learned: 

As with some of my previous Web design/devlopment projects, I have done this project to further sharpen my skills. Unlike some of my other Web projects, this was completed rather quickly for two reasons. The first is that I unfortunately did not have a lot of time to spend while I was traveling. The other is that this project revolved around a single static redesign rather than a Jekyll integrated multi-page blog site.  

Although this project was completed with relative haste, I intend to work my way back around to completing more of this project in the near future. Some of the things  I would like to do include integrating some of the well documented wiki data into a "Getting Started", "Instillation", and "Writer" pages.
