<p>You donâ€™t have to wait for someone else to tell you that it is okay to work on their GitHub project.</p>

<p>I had been kicking around the idea of refining some of my newfound Bootstrap3 skills by working on a few personal projects of my own. However, I came to the conclusion that it might be more fun to do something that someone else actually needs doing. So I headed over to GitHub and ran a few searches for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redesign</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">web redesign</code>. Surprisingly the query produced quite a few more results than I had expected. So I started leafing though a few to see if any might be a good candidate for my skill set. After combing over quite a few results, I realized that many of the Open issues with the previous tags seemed to need closing as the projects appeared to be completed.</p>

<p>So, I went ahead and changed the filters to display a list of the most current and open issues with the aforementioned tags. Again, I was surprised to see that many of the returned results did not actually have anything to do with the tags I was searching for. Regardless, I went ahead and skimmed though a few pages and a came up with a couple of candidates. When reviewing the redesign suggestions and requirements, I realized that many of the redesign request where looking for very similar elements.</p>

<p>After picking out a few projects, I drew up a few wire frames to get an idea of what the project pages would look like. I then realized that before I could come up with a complete redesign I would have to ask quite a few questions to each of the respective project owners. So, instead of wasting more time discussing redesign elements I decided to go ahead and simply redesign a project page one at a time to my liking. To me this seemed like a good idea. First, I would be able to get right down to development. Secondly, after redesigning the project page and posting here on my portfolio page I could have something physical to give to each project owner. Due to the nature of open source project and their rapid turnaround time, it just seems better to do first and then ask for approval at a later date.</p>
