<p>After several years of working diligently in a full time academic environment, I have been welcomed back to the workforce.</p>

<p>Surprisingly the opportunity was presented to me by a recruiter rather than a response from an employer due to an application submission or interview previously attended. The conversation with the recruiter went rather quickly and only two weeks later I ended finding myself employed. I am not so sure that putting much faith in social networking is something that I would advise to someone fresh out of college with no professional experience in a particular field. However, connecting with recruiters and having them find potential opportunities for you seems to be a little more efficient than submitting applications to job boards on the internet all day.</p>

<p>So, now I am getting the chance to work in an enterprise level software development environment. After being informed when my first day would be two feelings quickly rushed over me. The first was relief. I felt relieved that I could take a break from filling out applications and that I would be able to provide for my family once again-especially with the holidays drawing near. The second emotion was nervousness. Having a career record of spending 5+ years with each place of employment, I had forgotten what it was like to feel like the new person on the team.  I felt a little nervous about the people I would meet, but confident that I would be able to provide a benefit to the team.</p>
