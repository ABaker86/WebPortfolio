<p>Redesigning an open source project  Web page may be easier than one might originally think.</p>

<p>There are many current Websites dedicated to explaining the processes needed for redesigning a Website. However, these articles seem to be exclusively focused on enterprise Web bases. In order to cut down on all of the “fluff”, a single word can be used to identify the processes for redesigning an open source project page-inspiration. If your project is well documented then all you should need is a little inspiration.</p>

<p>Think about it, almost every software development tool you use has a website. If you are looking for inspiration you could simply leaf though a few of your favorite software tool Websites. On the other hand, you could check out Trek Glowacki’s website <a href="http://beautifulopen.com/ “Visit BeautifulOpen.com”">BeautifulOpen.com</a>.  This Website is dedicated to displaying some of the more elegant Web designs used by software project Websites.</p>

<p>Just yesterday I had the opportunity to spend a little time redesigning the jTags open source project page for a second time. To say the least, I am significantly more pleased with the results the second time around. The redesign was based on a few software project pages referenced on BeautifulOpen.com. Using Bootstrap 3, I was able to whip together a very simple, clean, and responsive redesign for the jTags Jekyll Website.</p>

<p>The process of redesigning the jTags project Website was very enjoyable. I would like to further my experience in future to include bootstrap’s JavaScript carousel and transition components. I look forward to doing a few more open source project Website redesigns.</p>
