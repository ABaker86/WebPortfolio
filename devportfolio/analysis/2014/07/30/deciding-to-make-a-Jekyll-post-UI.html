<p>Although Jekyll is a blogging platform “designed for developers” there are some things that I find to be very repetitive.</p>

<p>So, I decided to throw together a streamlined UI for Jekyll that will allow the user to write their posts in markdown, but not require the repetitive terminal commands. Some of the features that I intend to implement include the ability to modify the category and automatic time stamp generation. Due to Jekyll being available on Linux, IOS, and Windows (with a workaround), I decided to write the program in Java. Java will allow me to create a single multi-platform application. If all goes well, my next post should be with my new Jekyll UI!</p>
