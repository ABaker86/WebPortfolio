<p>Using keyboard shortcuts to get the job done can save you a whole lot of time and headaches.</p>

<p>When working on my latest project I have come to realize the significant benefits behind knowing a few simple keyboard shortcuts. Currently, I have been using a framework for developing ASP.NET applications. Although creating custom controls and developing the logic required behind them are somewhat easy to grasp. However, there are some instances when I have wanted to do something one way just to find out that the framework prevented me from accomplishing my intended goal. This is where knowing a few simple keyboard shortcuts comes into play. The shortcut I keep finding myself using the most is the find (ctrl/cmd + f )  and Go to Definition (V.S. - F12) shortcuts.</p>

<p>For instance if I want to determining how the framework handles a particular method I can simply search (ctrl/cmd + f ) for what I am trying to do such as “Response.Redirect” or “Server.Transfer”. If I am searching the entire project solution this process will allow me to determine which method is used and how the parameters are formatted for each method before writing my own.</p>

<p>On the other hand if I find myself getting errors or am interested in how to genericize a method that is already in the framework to accommodate an edge case scenario I simply highlight the method and press F12. This will direct V.S. to the source page and method within the project. After reviewing methods in this way I can make a determination on how to go about refactoring the method to accommodate my particular situations needs.</p>
