I finally got around to creating my first static blog. Using Jekyll and Github I belive that I now have a confortable place on the web to post what I am working on and express my thoughs. 

I know that there are a rediculous amount of bloggin platform options available. However, I am a beliver in the concept of "If you don't use it, you lose it". So in order to keep my skills up to date and/or improving I thought updating my site via the termina of my Linux box might be a good idea -at least it is keeping my hands on the keyboard for now. Regardelss, the world of technology is constantly evolving and I am sure that there several things that I would like to learn, discuss, or just make a note of for future reference.
