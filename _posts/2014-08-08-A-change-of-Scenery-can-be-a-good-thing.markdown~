Over the past weekend I took off and headed up to Chicago, IL and it was not for the ever popular Lollapalooza in the parks. 

Instead, my destination was Navy Pier. I was heading north to attend my college graduation commencement ceremony. 

Now, I have always been told that I am a shy person that needs to have time to warm up to people. I am not a fan of taking to groups of people regardless of the size, and navigating through, in, or around large groups is not something that I have ever looked forward to. Needless to say, largely populated cities rank at the bottom of my vacation destination list.  

However, I had a really good time getting out of my normal routine and meeting other like-minded individuals and college grads that I attended courses with. Not only did I meet up with other IT students from American InterContinental University (AIU), but I also got to meet quite a few people with other educational backgrounds. I was really surprised to see how positive everyone was regardless of the individual obstacles each one may have faced simply trying to get to the destination. 

This trip helped me to better realize the importance of getting involved with others members in the IT community within my living area. Just a few weeks ago I was interviewing for a position that lead me to discover a programming group right in the center of town where I live. Unfortunately, I am the president of my home owners association and its meeting schedule conflicts with the IT meetup. So, it looks like may have to delegate out some meetings to other officers in order to attend any of the IT meetups within this calendar year.
