There are a few issues that seem to commonly spring up for your average freelance, cowboy coders, and all around green developers. Some of these issues include Interpreting specs, getting the architecture correct, testing, muli-platform compatibility, others. Some of these areas of issue are even commonly lumped into the category of “dealing with the customer”.  

For the developers going it alone from the beginning, it is important to possibly learn a new process or even skill. However, those that have some education under their belt could make their lives a lot easier by simply using what they have been taught. Regardless, there tends to be no better way to begin working on a project than by writing/reviewing the documentation first.

Recently a survey has been posed to the developers at [Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/script/Surveys/VoteForm.aspx?srvid=1649) asking what developers believe is the hardest part of writing an App. To no surprise, many of the developers within the community believe that dealing with the client tends to be the most difficult aspect of writing Apps. However, Interpreting specs and correctly working out the architecture rank as the most difficult tasks. 

In order to reduce this “difficulty with creating new Apps”, writing/reading documentation can significantly relive some confusion throughout the process. Not only does writing up some paper documents pre-code help developers get a grasp of what the App specs and architecture are intended to look like, but also help prevent developers form making poor early decisions and future mistakes. One of the developers stated that they generally wait a few days before coding anything so that they could have enough time to discuss the design and development process with peers and write appropriate documentation. 

Of course not every application or freelance quick-fix will need heavy documentation, but it is undoubtedly  a good practice to get yourself into. Even on my smaller projects I find myself writing up a few design documents before jumping into the code. Sometimes I have to rewrite my design documents more than once before I get them right. I find that one of the most useful types of documents is the UML diagram. Not only does UML provide me with reference documentation, but it also provides me with a visual aid as well. 

So, before jumping into a project, tame those wild application specs and architecture by writing and/or reviewing the documentation first.
