Over the past week I have spent a little time tinkering around with a slimmed down Jekyll UI. I have come up with what I belive is a really good first draft. 

The UI allows the user to write a Jekyll post, title, and category, and allow the user to save the post withint the local Jekyll post directory. Although I would like to pour energy into this little project, I don't think that it is something that will really help me pay my shcool bills. So, I will have to throw this project onto the pile of "Spare time projects".
