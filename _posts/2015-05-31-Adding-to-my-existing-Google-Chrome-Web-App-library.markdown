I have recently decided to add new tool to my Google Chrome Web App library. 

For some time now I have been attempting to find the time to put into expanding my collection of Google Chrome Web Apps. One of my biggest setbacks to actually accomplishing this task is the fact that I generally have a hard time coming up with an application that I would want to create and that would provide some benifit to someone other than myself. However, the last few months of working in the industry have lead me to have a collection of simple applications and not need them than to need one and not have it-or more importantly-not have the time to create the tool. To this end I have decided to go ahead and spend some of my spare time writing up designs and researching coding practices that will allow me to port or create a toolbox of software tools that I can take with me everywhere so long as I have access to the Google Chrome Web Browser. 

Creating all of my tools for the Chrome Web Browser may seem to be a bit of an over proprietary approach. However, with the experience and software collection gainded by creating these tools I hope to expand my reach to other browers such as FireFox and possibly other platforms. 

My latest tool is called "SearchInFile". The application allows the user to search for specificed text within a file. The user is allowed to select one or more files to search through. After the file(s) have been searched, a visual indicator will be displayed for each file indicating whether the selected text has been found.
