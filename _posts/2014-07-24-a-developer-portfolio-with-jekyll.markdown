I finally got around to creating my first static blog. Using Jekyll and Github, I believe that I now have a comfortable place on the web to post what I am working on and express my thoughts. 

I know that there are a ridiculous amount of blogging platform options available. However, I am a believer in the concept of "If you don't use it, you lose it". So in order to keep my skills up to date and/or improving I thought updating my site via the terminal of my Linux box might be a good idea -at least it is keeping my hands on the keyboard for now. Regardless, the world of technology is constantly evolving and I am sure that there several things that I would like to learn, discuss, or just make a note of for future reference. 

Before deciding to use Jekyll I felt the need to do a little research to make sure that I was not getting in over my head with the amount of work required to deploy such a site. Although the Jekyll home page has quite a bit of documentation, it seems to be lacking a step-by-step guide. However, I did come across a very nice article on the Internet written by Anna Debenham. The article ["Get Started With GitHub Pages (Plus Bonus Jekyll)"](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) was very informative. I found that it seemed to fill the missing pieces left out by the actual Jekyll home page.
