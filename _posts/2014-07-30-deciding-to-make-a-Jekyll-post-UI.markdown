Over the past few days I have been throwing some ideas around for my next project. Although Jekyll is a blogging platform "designed for developers" there are some things that I find to be very repeditive. 

So, I decided to throw together a streamlined UI for Jekyll that will allow the user to write their posts in markdown, but not require the repedative terminal commands. Some of the features that I intend to implement include the ability to modify the category and automatic time stamp generation. Due to Jekyll being available on Linux, IOS, and Windows (with a workaround), I decided to write the program in Java. Java will alow me to create a single multi-platform application. If all goes well, my next post should be with my new Jekyll UI!
