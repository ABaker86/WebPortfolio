It is with great joy that I can now say that I am a Microsoft Certified. As of March 14, 2016 I have taken and passed the Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3 Specialist certification. 

At the beginning of the year I mad the decision to follow Microsoft's Web Developer certification path to obtain the title of Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer. Conveniently, after college I began working in the IT field developing data driven Web applications. The real life experience made preparing for the first certification test much easier. Additionally, I have developed other web applications utilizing HTML-in general- and browser applications in HTML5, JavaScript, & CSS3 such as 'File Search' for Google Chrome. Although I had previous experience, I realized that it was important to identify various elements of developing with HTML5 that I should know for the certification but do not usually use in regular development practice.

Resources that I found useful include 'Murach's HTML5 & CSS3', 'Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3: Exam Ref 70-480', and the Microsoft Virtual Academy video training series 'HTML5 & CSS3 Fundamentals: Development for Absolute Beginners' & 'Developing in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS Jump Start'.Within a few weeks of beginning my self-paced training I decided to set date to take the first certification test to get the ball rolling. Conveniently, after taking the exam I was provided with my passing results. With a passing result of my fist certification I have now earned the title of Microsoft Certified Professional/ Technology Specialist. 

I am now currently working on preparing for my next exam: 70-486 Developing ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Applications. I am currently targeting a mid-year date for the next certification exam. Additionally, I am planning on implementing aspects of ASP.NET MVC 4 into my work development practices to provide a real-world application and further my understanding to better prepare myself.
