In the ever-evolving realm of technology, staying abreast of advancements is not just an option but a necessity. <!--more--> Recently, I took on the task of reworking my professional portfolio website, not only to give it a fresh look but also to rekindle my familiarity with technologies like Jekyll and Ruby.

## Embracing Simplicity and Functionality
The driving force behind this redesign was simplicity and functionality. A clean and efficient design not only pleases the eye but also enhances the user experience. Jekyll, with its static site generation capabilities, proved to be the ideal choice for achieving this years ago so I have decided to stick with it.

## Relearning Ruby: The Heart of Jekyll
While diving into the redesign process, I realized I needed to brush up on my Ruby and Liquid templating skills. As Jekyll is built using Ruby and Liquid, a loose understanding of each language is crucial. I revisited the essentials, delving into Ruby and Liquid templating syntax, dependencies, and functions. This reacquaintance not only powered my website's redesign but also reignited my passion for learning new things-even if I have fogotten I knew them.

## A Work in Progress: Continuous Evolution
The journey of redesigning my portfolio website doesn't end hereâ€”it's an ongoing endeavor. Technology is constantly changing, and my website must keep pace. Future iterations will integrate new features, optimize performance, and refine the user interface.

In summary, this redesign journey has not only revitalized my portfolio website but also reignited my passion for working with code. It's a testament to the fact that learning never stops in the tech world, and every step we take adds a stroke to the canvas of our digital journey.
