The First application I designed, developed, and deployed entierly by my self was none other than a Google Packaged App.

Fill out the form, choose style, see result then get the code, ready for your e-mail client.
The signature can include your name, position, and a short'n snappy quote.

Many forums that permit graphical signatures have image size limits of approximate 500 pixels wide by 150 pixels tall. With this signature generator your graphic will be 482 pixels long by 113 pixels tall-making it appropriate for most forums.


Above all else this is an interesting little application built to help graphic design illiterate IT developers  generate custom forum signature icons.
